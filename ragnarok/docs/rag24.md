# Ragnarök: End-to-end RAG Baselines for TREC-Researchy 24 and TREC-RAGgy 24

This document describes the end-to-end retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) baselines for the TREC-Researchy 24 and TREC-RAGgy 24 development sets. All systems are grounded on the MS MARCO V2.1 segmented doc corpus curated for the TREC 2024 RAG Track. The baselines are based on [Anserini's BM25 first-stage retrieval](https://github.com/castorini/anserini) followed by [RankLLM's multi-step RankZephyr](https://github.com/castorini/rank_llm) reranking and finally, augmented-generation with one of OpenAI's GPT-4o, Cohere's Command R+ or Meta's LLaMA-3.1 (8B + 70B). Note that the reranking step is optional and can be skipped if you only want to use the first-stage BM25 retrieval. The generation step can also be skipped if you only plan to submit systems to the (R)etriaval subtask.

## Retrieval - BM25

The following commands show how to run Anserini's BM25 on the dev sets i.e., TREC-Researchy 24 and TREC-RAGgy 24, and evaluate effectiveness, on the segmented doc corpus:

Anserini is packaged in a self-contained fatjar, which also provides the simplest way to get started. Assuming you've already got Java installed, fetch the fatjar:

```bash
wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/anserini/anserini/0.36.1/anserini-0.36.1-fatjar.jar
```

```bash
export ANSERINI_JAR=anserini-0.36.1-fatjar.jar
export OUTPUT_DIR="runs"
TOPICS=(rag24.raggy-dev rag24.researchy-dev)
for t in "${TOPICS[@]}"; do 
    java -cp $ANSERINI_JAR io.anserini.search.SearchCollection \
        -index msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented \
        -topics $t \
        -output $OUTPUT_DIR/run.msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented.bm25.${t}.txt \
        -threads 16 \
        -bm25 \
        -hits 100 \
        -outputRerankerRequests $OUTPUT_DIR/retrieve_results_msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented.bm25.${t}_top100.jsonl &
done
```
        
Note the generated TREC run files (not the reranker requests JSONL file) showcase the expected output format for the (R)etrieval step.

We can check the first five lines:
```bash
head -5 runs/run.msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented.bm25.rag24.researchy-dev.txt
```

You should see the following output:
```bash
429 Q0 msmarco_v2.1_doc_54_319914167#4_733739871 1 18.287600 Anserini
429 Q0 msmarco_v2.1_doc_54_319914167#3_733737735 2 18.057400 Anserini
429 Q0 msmarco_v2.1_doc_42_560302062#12_1088743034 3 18.055201 Anserini
429 Q0 msmarco_v2.1_doc_35_1306810123#2_3040954932 4 17.912500 Anserini
429 Q0 msmarco_v2.1_doc_35_1306810123#8_3040961879 5 17.606800 Anserini
```
Ensure to update `Anserini` with the `run-id` your team wants associated with the run file prior to submission, if you do include such a run in your submissions.

Similarly the first line of the reranker requests file (limited to two candidates) can be checked as follows:

```bash
head -1 runs/retrieve_results_msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented.bm25.rag24.researchy-dev_top100.jsonl | jq '.query, .candidates[0:2]'
```
You should see the following output:

We'll be using the JSONL reranker requests files generated by the Anserini for the reranking step. These are pre-cached with document contents allowing us to offload dependencies in RankLLM. We can check their line counts as follows (number of queries):

```bash
wc -l ${OUTPUT_DIR}/retrieve_results_msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented.bm25.rag24.raggy-dev_top100.jsonl
wc -l ${OUTPUT_DIR}/retrieve_results_msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented.bm25.rag24.researchy-dev_top100.jsonl
```

You should see the following output:

```bash
120 runs/retrieve_results_msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented.bm25.rag24.raggy-dev_top100.jsonl
600 runs/retrieve_results_msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented.bm25.rag24.researchy-dev_top100.jsonl
```


We host these files for the dev sets i.e., TREC-Researchy 24 and TREC-RAGgy 24 [here](https://github.com/castorini/ragnarok_data/tree/main/retrieve_results/BM25).

## Reranking - RankLLM - RankZephyr-Rho

We can use RankLLM to run RankZephyr-Rho on the reranker request files generated in the previous step. The following commands show how to run RankLLM on the dev sets i.e., TREC-Researchy 24 and TREC-RAGgy 24:

```bash
RANK_LLM=<path-to-rank-llm>
cp runs/retrieve_results_msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented.bm25.rag24.raggy-dev_top100.jsonl ${RANK_LLM}/retrieve_results/BM25/
cp runs/retrieve_results_msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented.bm25.rag24.researchy-dev_top100.jsonl ${RANK_LLM}/retrieve_results/BM25/
cd ${RANK_LLM}
pip3 install -e .
```


We show how to run RankLLM on the dev sets i.e., TREC-Researchy 24 and TREC-RAGgy 24.
Let's run inference!
    
```bash
python src/rank_llm/scripts/run_rank_llm.py  --model_path=castorini/rank_zephyr_7b_v1_full --top_k_candidates=100 --dataset=msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented.bm25.rag24.raggy-dev --retrieval_method=bm25 --prompt_mode=rank_GPT --context_size=4096 --variable_passages --num_passes=3 --vllm_batched
python src/rank_llm/scripts/run_rank_llm.py  --model_path=castorini/rank_zephyr_7b_v1_full --top_k_candidates=100 --dataset=msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented.bm25.rag24.researchy-dev --retrieval_method=bm25 --prompt_mode=rank_GPT --context_size=4096 --variable_passages --num_passes=3 --vllm_batched
```

This should create both TREC run files and JSONL files after each pass and the final reranked JSONL files can serve as input to our augmented generation component. 
We host these files for the dev sets i.e., TREC-Researchy 24 and TREC-RAGgy 24 [here](https://github.com/castorini/ragnarok_data/tree/main/retrieve_results/RANK_ZEPHYR_RHO).

These files can be moved to `ragnarok`'s retrieve_results (in either BM25/RANK_ZEPHYR_RHO)

```bash
cp <path-to-ragnarok-data>/retrieve_results/RANK_ZEPHYR_RHO/* <path-to-ragnarok>/retrieve_results/RANK_ZEPHYR_RHO/
cp <path-to-ragnarok-data>/retrieve_results/BM25/* <path-to-ragnarok>/retrieve_results/BM25/
```

## Augmented Generation 

Clone the ragnarök repository and setup from source:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:castorini/ragnarok.git
cd ragnarok
pip install -e .
```

Note that running augmented generation requires an API key for OpenAI's GPT-4o or Cohere's Command R+. The following commands show how to run the augmented generation step with GPT-4o on the dev sets i.e., TREC-Researchy 24 and TREC-RAGgy 24, assuming you have set `CO_API_KEY` for Cohere's API key and `OPENAI_API_KEY` for OpenAI's API key:

### Augmented Generation - GPT-4o (ChatQA-Inspired Prompt)

The following commands show how to run the augmented generation step with GPT-4o (using a prompt inspired by ChatQA) on the dev sets i.e., TREC-Researchy 24 and TREC-RAGgy 24:

```bash
SET=msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented.bm25.rank_zephyr_rho.rag24.raggy-dev
python -um ragnarok.scripts.run_ragnarok  --model_path=gpt-4o  --topk=100,20 --dataset=${SET}  --retrieval_method=bm25,rank_zephyr_rho --prompt_mode=chatqa  --context_size=8192 --max_output_tokens=1500 --use_azure_openai --run_id bm25_rank-zephyr-rho_gpt-4o

SET=msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented.bm25.rank_zephyr_rho.rag24.researchy-dev
python -um ragnarok.scripts.run_ragnarok  --model_path=gpt-4o  --topk=100,20 --dataset=${SET}  --retrieval_method=bm25,rank_zephyr_rho --prompt_mode=chatqa  --context_size=8192 --max_output_tokens=1500 --use_azure_openai --run_id bm25_rank-zephyr-rho_gpt-4o

### Augmented Generation - Command R+



The following commands show how to run the augmented generation step with Command R+ on the dev sets i.e., TREC-Researchy 24 and TREC-RAGgy 24:

```bash

We host these files for subsets of the dev sets i.e., TREC-Researchy 24 and TREC-RAGgy 24 [here](https://github.com/castorini/ragnarok_data/tree/main/results/RANK_ZEPHYR_RHO). 
We shall provide larger subsets after some prompt refinements.
We encourage participants to run the full pipelines on the entire dev sets with caution as the generation step can be expensive.

### Augmented Generation - Meta LLaMA-3.1 (70B)

The following commands show how to run the augmented generation step with Meta's LLaMA-3.1 (70B) on the dev sets i.e., TREC-Researchy 24 and TREC-RAGgy 24:

```bash
SET=msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented.bm25.rank_zephyr_rho.rag24.raggy-dev
python -um ragnarok.scripts.run_ragnarok  --model_path=meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct  --topk=20 --dataset=${SET}  --retrieval_method=bm25 --prompt_mode=chatqa  --context_size=8192 --max_output_tokens=1500 --run_id bm25_rank-zephyr-rho_command-r-plus_l3.1_70b --num_gpus 4 --vllm_batched; 

SET=msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented.bm25.rank_zephyr_rho.rag24.researchy-dev
python -um ragnarok.scripts.run_ragnarok  --model_path=meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct  --topk=20 --dataset=${SET}  --retrieval_method=bm25 --prompt_mode=chatqa  --context_size=8192 --max_output_tokens=1500 --run_id bm25_rank-zephyr-rho_command-r-plus_l3.1_70b --num_gpus 4 --vllm_batched; 
```

You can run the 8B model with a similar command by replacing the model path with `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`, num_gpus with 1 and run_id with `bm25_rank-zephyr-rho_command-r-plus_l3.1_8b`.


### Verifying AG/RAG Output

We recommend running `src/ragnarok/scripts/check_trec_rag24_gen.py` to verify the output adheres to the expected format. This is our checking script for RAG/AG tracks. You can see if your systems conform to it. The script will maintain an errorlog and in the case of some cases also attempt to fix warnings (too long -> we remove sentences from the end, dupe citations -> we remove them, etc.). You’ll get a fixed file if the errors are not major that you can resubmit but please go through all the warnings and error messages to make sure you and the script are doing things *as expected*!
```bash
python3 src/ragnarok/scripts/check_trec_rag24_gen.py /store2/scratch/rpradeep/ragnarok_data/results/RANK_ZEPHYR/baseline_rag24.test_gpt-4o_top20.jsonl.fixed --topicfile /store2/scratch/rpradeep/anserini-tools/topics-and-qrels/topics.rag24.test.txt
